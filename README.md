tablefilter
===========

tableFilter is a lightweight jQuery plugin to enable efficient client-side searching and filtering for HTML tables.

The key design goals behind table filter were to:

* Maintain clean HTML mark-up
* Maintain developer control over styling and HTML input binding
* Optionally integrate with HTML5 localStorage

I originally authored this library back in 10/2012, but have since overhauled it.

I haven't updated the old documentation to the new way of doing things, but I'm working on it.

As soon as this is done, I'll push it out here and at www.sberry.me/tablefilter.
